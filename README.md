#Old Church Slavonic Lemmatizer#

Overview

A GUI-based tool for lemmatizing Old Church Slavonic (OCS) texts using a dictionary of word-lemma pairs. Users can input text, view lemmatized results, and explore datasets through 
an intuitive interface.

Features

Text Lemmatization: 
                   Matches words with their most frequent lemma.
Word-Lemma Table: 
                  Displays word-lemma mappings in a tabular format.
Dataset Viewer:
                    Browse and view dataset files.
Interactive GUI: 
                  Built with tkinter for ease of use.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/usmannawaz01/Old-Church-Slavonic-Lemmatizer.git

Run the app:
python ocs_lemmatizer.py


Usage

Paste OCS text into the input box.
Click Lemmatize Text to generate lemmatized output.
View Word-Lemma Table or explore datasets with View Datasets.


Dataset Attribution
The Old Church Slavonic dataset used for this project is sourced from the Syntacticus Project, and we have organized the dataset to suit our specific research needs.
This dataset includes the PROIEL Treebank and the TOROT Treebank, both of which provide morphosyntactically annotated tokens from Old Church Slavonic texts.

You can find the dataset on the Syntacticus Project Website. ( https://syntacticus.org/)
